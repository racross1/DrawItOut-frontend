# Draw It Out

# Goal: 
    The goal of our application is to allow Users the ability to create personal canvasses and associated a topic with it. Everyone has a subjective interpretation of defined moods or emotions, and this app gives them the creative freedom to draw out how they are feeling. Create a log or journal entry of drawings that you may revisit, or simply use this application as a standalone canvas. The choice is yours!
